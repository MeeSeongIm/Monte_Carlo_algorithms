Percolation [an union-find application].

Consider an $N \times N$ grid of blocks; each block is a called a site. 
Each site is open (not shaded) with probability p or blocked (shaded) with probability 1-p. 
A system percolates if and only if a block on the top row of the grid and a block on the bottom row of the grid 
are connected by open sites, where two adjacent blocks are connected if and only if both are open.

Application: 
model 								system				vacant site		occupied site			percolates
electricity							material			conductor		insulated				conducts
fluid flow							material			empty			blocked					porous
social interaction					population			person			empty					communicates
rock fractures from earthquakes		fracture networks	fractures		crystalline rock		connectivity of the network


Given a randomized model, i.e., a site is vacant with a given probability, if the probability is low, 
then there is a good chance that the system will not percolate. 
On the other hand, if the probability is high, then there is a good chance that the system will percolate. 
When this probability is somewhere in the middle, it is an open question (in mathematics and in physics) 
on determining whether or not the system percolates. 

Percolation phase transition: 
When N >> 0, this theory guarantees the existence of a sharp threshold p* such that the following holds: 
1. when p > p*, the system almost certainly percolates, 
2. when p < p*, the system almost certainly does not percolate. 

Open problem: determine the value of p*.
